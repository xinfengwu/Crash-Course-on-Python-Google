# An intern implemented a zip code checker, but it works only with five-digit zip codes. Your task is to update the checker so that it includes all nine digits of the zip code; the leading five digits and the optional four after the hyphen. The zip code needs to be preceded by at least one space, and cannot be at the start of the text. Update the regular expression.

import re
def correct_function(text):
  result = re.search(r"( \d{5}-\d{4})|( \d{5})", text)  # Corrected regex pattern with space
  return result is not None

def check_zip_code(text):
  return correct_function(text)  # Call the correct_function

# Call the check_zip_code function with test cases
print(check_zip_code("The zip codes for New York are 10001 thru 11104."))  # True
print(check_zip_code("90210 is a TV show"))  # False (no space before 90210)
print(check_zip_code("Their address is: 123 Main Street, Anytown, AZ 85258-0001."))  # True
print(check_zip_code("The Parliament of Canada is at 111 Wellington St, Ottawa, ON K1A0A9."))  # False
